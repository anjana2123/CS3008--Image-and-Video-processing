Take any colour image. Ensure that the resolution of the image is 512x512. Convert this into a gray scale image.
Write  python codes to perform any 5 transformations on the image. (Example: obtain the negative of the image.) 
You are free to use any python package and use appropriate functions for your transformations. 
It will be great if you can write your own python code ( without using standard library functions). 
Submit your result as a .ipynb file
