# Image and Video Processing Course Assignments Repository

Welcome to the Image and Video Processing Course Assignments repository! This repository is dedicated to storing my assignment works for the Image and Video Processing course. The majority of the assignments will be in the form of Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files.

## Folder Structure

- **`assignments`**: Each assignment has its own folder. Inside, you'll find the assignment details and the corresponding Jupyter Notebook files.
